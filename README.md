# archimateviewer
Viewer for Archimate based on the Open Group Exchange Format

The project now contains only three basic files:
- archimatetool.xsl transform an archimatetool (www.archimatetool.com) xml file to the archimate open group exchange format xml (http://www.opengroup.org/xsd/archimate/)
- index.xsl creates the index page
- browsepages.xsl creates a page for each element or view 

Xml can be transformed by using Saxon9HE for exmaple.

Far from finished but a good start. Have to learn GitHub at the same time
